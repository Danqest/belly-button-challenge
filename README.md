# belly-button-challenge

This repository is an exercise in using javascript to read a json file of data and display metadata and graphical information on an html page.
The data explores bacterial samples and cultures derived from human subjects, with pieces of the html page adjusting output based on selected samples from a dropdown menu.
Technologies used include D3.js which is a javascript library for manipulating html documents using data as well as Plotly.js which is a javascript libary for charting.
The deployed page can be found at: https://danqest.github.io/belly-button-challenge/
